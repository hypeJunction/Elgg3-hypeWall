## Notes

* Reverse geocoding is performed via Nominatim http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim.
Reverse geocoding (i.e. browser position coordinates to human readable address)
will not work in https. Implement a custom solution using a paid/free/proprietary
service that does the same

* Icons are not included with the plugin. You will need to load FontAwesome CSS,
either by registering it in your theme, or using one of the available Elgg plugins.


## Developer Notes

* You can add wall tabs and forms by extending the ```'framework/wall/container/extend'``` view
